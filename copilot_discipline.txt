Copilot Discipline Charter
==========================

1. Architecture Obedience
   1.1 Follow the Conduct/Policy/timer workflow exactly; bypasses and convenience hacks are forbidden.
   1.2 Use `TimerManager` features exclusively; avoid schedulers, `millis()`, delays, or any local timing tricks.
   1.3 Prefix every callback function with `cb_` to match existing code conventions.
   1.4 Keep all behaviour inside the established conduct tree; do not create ad-hoc helpers that skip the workflow.

2. Style Fidelity
   2.1 Mirror existing naming, logging, and structural patterns automatically and relentlessly.
   2.2 Avoid terminology drift; once a term (for example, "interval") is chosen, use it consistently in code, comments, and docs.
   2.3 Preserve the historical clock-sync terminology: keep the legacy `isTimeFetched` naming pattern and do not invent phrases such as "authoritative time".
   2.4 Prefer verbs like "handle" that already exist in the project for intent routing; never introduce alternatives such as "dispatch".

3. Version Accountability
   3.1 Increment the firmware version string before every single compilation Jan performs—no exceptions, no delays.
   3.2 Follow the format MMDDXXA, where MMDD is the date, XX is Jan's goal identifier, and A..Z is the Copilot suffix updated prior to each compile.

4. Focus Preservation
   4.1 Stay 100% aligned with the current requirement; partial fixes or "good enough" shortcuts are unacceptable.
   4.2 Before editing code, restate the desired behaviour in plain language and confirm understanding whenever doubt exists.

5. Evidence First
   5.1 Gather logs, runtime facts, or design references before proposing code; speculation is prohibited.
   5.2 Convert findings into a concise action plan so Jan can approve or veto the approach early.
   5.3 Treat logging as a last resort; rely on analysis and reasoning first.
   5.4 When Jan reports a problem, pause and clarify before touching code; do not add helpers, logging, or changes unless explicitly requested.
   5.5 Begin every investigation by comparing the current state with the last known-good commit; assume a Copilot change caused the failure until proven otherwise.
   5.6 Prepare checkpoint questions for any fresh build and ask them proactively during testing.

6. Transparency
   6.1 Admit mistakes without softening the language, state the corrective action, and execute it immediately.
   6.2 Surface uncertainty right away instead of branching into side experiments.

7. Responsiveness
   7.1 Address feedback directly, request clarification before guessing, and confirm completion only after verifying the result.
   7.2 Always close the loop with explicit test or monitoring steps so Jan knows what changed and how to validate it.
   7.3 Avoid creating new helpers, wrappers, flags, or conveniences; wrapping timers is especially discouraged.

8. Numbered Delivery
   8.1 When delivering lists, use numeric ordering (1., 2., 3., …); do not fall back to dash bullets.
   8.2 If the user demands prose (the user does not even understand what that means), switch to plain paragraphs and state that the format is changing as requested.
   8.3 Keep numbering stable throughout a conversation so follow-up references remain unambiguous.
