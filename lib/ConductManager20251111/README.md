# Conduct Manager Architecture

Every subsystem that lives under `lib/ConductManager20251111/**` follows the same stack so we can iterate on behaviour without touching boot code, timers, or hardware drivers. The stack is strict—skip a layer and you get bugs that are impossible to reason about later.

## Layer Contract

| Layer | Responsibility | Typical Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Boot** | Register timers, seed caches, hand off any pointers that conduct/policy will need later. Boot files run exactly once during system bring-up. | `AudioBoot.*`, `LightBoot.*`, `ConductBoot.*`, `BootMaster.*` |
| **Conduct** | Orchestrate intents. They own timer callbacks, subscribe to manager signals, and decide which director to invoke. Conduct code may _sequence_ work but must not invent behaviour. | `*Conduct.*`, `ConductManager.*` |
| **Director** | Translate context + storage into actionable requests. Directors query managers (state, SD indices, calendar rows) and shape the payload that policies evaluate. They never touch hardware APIs directly. | `*Director.*` |
| **Policy** | Enforce rules for a single domain (audio, light, OTA, etc.). Policies approve/deny requests, clamp levels, pick intervals, and expose helpers such as “distance playback volume”. They cannot schedule timers or manipulate global singletons. | `*Policy.*` |
| **Manager** | Own hardware drivers and runtime state. Managers expose query/update APIs and keep the state machines honest. | `AudioManager.*`, `LightManager.*`, `SDManager.*`, ... |
| **Hardware** | Actual drivers (I²S, FastLED, SPI, GPIO). Only managers touch these.

## Intent Flow

1. An input source (web, timers, calendar, sensors) raises an intent via `ConductManager::intent*` or a subsystem-specific entry point.
2. The owning **Conduct** module validates prerequisites (boot complete, timer slots free) and invokes the matching **Director**.
3. The **Director** builds a request composed of current context (calendar themes, distance cache, OTA arm window, etc.).
4. The **Policy** evaluates that request, returning either approval plus concrete parameters or a rejection reason.
5. If approved, the **Conduct** code asks the appropriate **Manager** to execute. Managers update hardware via their drivers and report state back up the stack.

## Boot Discipline

- `BootMaster` coordinates shared start-up (clock seeding, fallback timers) and hands off to `ConductBoot` once common services are alive.
- Each subsystem boot (`AudioBoot`, `LightBoot`, etc.) is responsible for: registering timers with `TimerManager`, caching pointers (e.g. PCM clips), and logging readiness via `PL("[Conduct][Plan] ...")`.
- Boot layers must never start behaviour directly. They only prepare the scaffolding so that `ConductManager::update()` and the subsystem conductors can run deterministically.

## Logging + Telemetry Rules

- Use `PL("[Conduct][Plan] ...")` for lifecycle events and conductor state changes so the boot log shows every registration in order.
- Directors and policies log through `[AudioDirector]`, `[LightPolicy]`, etc. Keep rejection reasons explicit so conductors can surface them upstream without guessing.
- Timer churn stays visible by logging whenever a conductor parks or re-arms a slot (especially for distance audio and OTA windows).

## Do / Don’t Checklist

- ✅ Conduct owns timers, sequencing, retries, and is the only layer that calls `TimerManager::restart`.
- ✅ Directors read data (calendar CSV, SD index, sensors) and return structured plans. They never make policy decisions.
- ✅ Policies accept a plan and spit back either a green-light (with concrete numbers) or “no” with a reason. No side effects besides cached clamp state.
- ✅ Managers expose explicit APIs for every action; do not reach into singletons or globals directly from conduct/policy code.
- ❌ No layer except managers talks to hardware (`FastLED`, `I2S`, `SPI`, raw GPIO).
- ❌ Policies never schedule timers, mutate manager state directly, or call other policies.
- ❌ Conductors do not normalise raw sensor readings—that belongs to the relevant input policy/manager.

Keeping these contracts tight lets us replace a policy, director, or even an entire subsystem without rewriting the rest of the pipeline.
